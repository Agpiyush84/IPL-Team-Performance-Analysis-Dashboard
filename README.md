# 🏏 IPL Team Performance Analysis Dashboard

A Power BI project that visualizes IPL team performances from 2008 to 2025 using advanced data modeling and DAX.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Evaluate IPL team performance across seasons using match-level, player-level, and ball-by-ball data to extract dynamic KPIs, rankings, and trends.

---

## ✅ Solution

Developed an interactive dashboard using **Power BI** to analyze team performance, wins/losses, run trends, and generate a dynamic points table per season.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI** (Reports, Visuals, DAX)
- **DAX** (Calculated columns, measures)
- **Data Modeling** (Relationships between 4+ tables)

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

Utilized 4 interconnected `.csv` files:

- `ipl_matches_data` – Match metadata from 2008 to 2025  
- `ball_by_ball_data` – Delivery-level information (50K+ KB)  
- `players-data-updated` – Player attributes & team mapping  
- `teams_data` – Official team information

---

## 🧮 DAX Measures & Metrics

- Total Runs Scored  
- Total Wickets Taken  
- Number of Sixes/Fours  
- Matches Played & Won  
- Centuries by Players  
- Dynamic Points Table  
- Win Percentage  
- Match Result Classification

---

## 📊 Dashboards

- **Overview Page** – Season-wise stats, team comparison  
- **Team Performance** – Win/loss trend, NRR, top players  
- **Points Table** – Season-wise DAX-powered table  
- **Match Breakdown** – Match results by team and margin  
- **Batting vs Bowling** – Runs, strike rate, wickets  

---

## 🔍 Insights

- Dominant teams vary by season — clear power shifts post-2017  
- Some teams consistently fail in away matches  
- High six-hitting correlates with match wins (esp. in 2023–25)  
- Close matches (<10 runs/1 wicket margin) have increased  
- Ball-by-ball data shows economy rate swings in death overs

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add player role segmentation (e.g., all-rounder impact)  
- Integrate prediction models for match outcomes  
- Simulate "What if" for team compositions and toss decisions
